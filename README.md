Probability distributions, their parameters, their use cases... all that can be very confusing at the beginning. At least it was to me... so I wrote this "cheat sheet" with a code sample of each of some of the most popular probability distributions useful for Data Science in order to view them, play them, check what happens when we manipulate ther input variables, and ultimately understand them.
